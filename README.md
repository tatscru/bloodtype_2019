# Bloodtype2019


READ ME— 

There are so many diets out there, have you ever thought of eating for your blood type? 

First step, learning your blood type. Second, evaluating previous diet or food trends, noting what has and has not worked, and jotting down your goal for this new diet. 

Now, how does it work?   

Many of us know, maintaining a nutritious food intake and exercise is one of the most important factors to living a healthy lifestyle. For some people, no matter how strictly they adhere to a diet, they do no seem to see a change in their body. A naturopathic physician proposed the idea that one's body processes food according to their blood type. It is believed that when food is digested, chemical reactions take place in our gut, directly affecting our blood and the lining of our digestive tracts.

People with specific blood types have certain stomach enzymes enabling them to process food differently. If you know your blood type, we will walk through beneficial foods, foods to avoid, and a sample menu. 

Project Structure 

**User types: What is your blood type?

Shows a list of the different blood types + food to eat and avoid 

1. Type O- If you are type O, like an estimated 46 percent of the population, the Eat Right 4 Your Type program suggests that you stay away from wheat, dairy, caffeine, and alcohol. Reach instead for fruits, vegetables, and lean, organic meats.

2. Type A- People whose blood is type A are steered toward a vegetarian diet, including soy proteins, grains, and vegetables. They are also encouraged to eat organic and fresh food in as natural a state as possible.

3. Type B- People whose blood is type B are identified as omnivores who can eat a variety of foods. They should avoid certain foods — like corn, wheat, buckwheat, lentils, tomatoes, peanuts, sesame seeds, and chicken — and instead opt for goat, lamb, mutton, rabbit, green vegetables, eggs, and low-fat dairy products

4. Type AB- People whose blood is type AB should choose tofu, seafood like mahi-mahi and salmon, dairy like yogurt and kefir, and green vegetables like kale and broccoli. They should avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoked and cured meats, and try to eat more small meals throughout the day, according to the diet.
