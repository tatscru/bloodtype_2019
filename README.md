# Bloodtype2019


READ ME— 

There are so many diets out there, one of them being the bloodtype diet.  As with any new meal plan, one will need to evaluate thier previous diets and food trends, noting what has and has not worked.  Secondly, one will need to know their blood type group in order to present a proper sample menu. 

Many of us know, maintaining a nutritious food intake and exercise is one of the most important factors to living a healthy lifestyle. For some people, no matter how strictly they adhere to a diet, they do no seem to see a change in their body. A naturopathic physician proposed the idea that one's body processes food according to their blood type. If you know your blood type, we will walk through the beneficial foods and one's to avoid, along with a sample menu.

**description


1. Type O - If you are type O, like an estimated 46 percent of the population, the Eat Right 4 Your Type program suggests that you stay away from wheat, dairy, caffeine, and alcohol. Reach instead for fruits, vegetables, and lean, organic meats.

2. Type A- People whose blood is type A are steered toward a vegetarian diet, including soy proteins, grains, and vegetables. They are also encouraged to eat organic and fresh food in as natural a state as possible.

3. Type B- People whose blood is type B are identified as omnivores who can eat a variety of foods. They should avoid certain foods — like corn, wheat, buckwheat, lentils, tomatoes, peanuts, sesame seeds, and chicken — and instead opt for goat, lamb, mutton, rabbit, green vegetables, eggs, and low-fat dairy products

4. Type AB- People whose blood is type AB should choose tofu, seafood like mahi-mahi and salmon, dairy like yogurt and kefir, and green vegetables like kale and broccoli. They should avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoked and cured meats, and try to eat more small meals throughout the day, according to the diet.
